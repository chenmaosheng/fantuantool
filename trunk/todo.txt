1, session功能完成
2, logicloop概念
3, logiccommand概念
4, sessionserver概念
5, minidump release版bug解决
6, server id
7, data stream(in/out) (finished)
8, memory management(not tested)
9, packet_buffer concept, similar to single buffer
10, sessionid index has problem(fixed)

11, ft gen need to generate file
12, starnet need connect concept (client function)
13, server config file
14, use memory pool
15, utf8<->wchar, consider about chinese character
16, alloca has memory leak
17, send more than 1 buf in wsasend
18, private key file
19, packet encryption

client
1, rpc->server, with parameters
2, serialize parameters to a datastream
3, retrieve buffer and length from datastream
4, use packet to wrap this buffer and add header info
5, send it

server
1, receive a raw buffer
2, check if buffer is larger than header
3, cut specific size from received buffer
4, put buffer into datastream
5, unserialize from datastream and retrieve parameters
6, call specific rpc function with parameters

static variable in lib file can't be loaded, it must be in exe project
